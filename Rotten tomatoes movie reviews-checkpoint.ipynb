       " <p>More movies being made than ever before! Coming out at an exponential clip! Yep, being a film buff in 2018 is a full-time gig. Fortunately, your presence here on Rotten Tomatoes has marked you as a person of discernible taste. So we propose to you, instead of watching all of the movies, how about just watching <em>the best movies</em>?</p>\n",
       " <p>Presenting our list of The Best Movies of 2018! From micro-indies to big budget blockbusters, this is the good stuff from our wild and momentous year — every movie here scored high on the Tomatometer, enough to get stamped Certified Fresh. We only included movies with a theatrical release, and we ranked them – which means we can now crown the Best Movie of 2018. Is it horror smash <em>A Quiet Place</em>? Mega comic crossover <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>? Hit documentary <em>Won’t You Be My Neighbor</em>? Animated game-changer <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>? Or something else entirely? You’ll have to read on for the answer to that ultimate question, but we can tell you that some recent additions include a surprising appearance by <em>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again</em> and yet another fantastic biographical documentary in <em>McQueen</em>, as well as a handful of festival hits like <em>Sorry to Bother You</em>, <em>Blindspotting</em>, and <em>Eighth Grade</em>. Happy watching!</p>\n",

CAPERNAUM was made with a cast of non-professionals playing characters whose lives closely parallel their own. Following her script, Labaki placed her performers in scenes and asked them to react spontaneously with their own words and gestures. When the non-actors\\'s instincts diverged from the written script, Labaki adapted the screenplay to follow them. While steeped in the quiet routines of ordinary people, CAPERNAUM is a film with an expansive palette: without warning it can ignite with emotional intensity, surprise with unexpected tenderness, and inspire with flashes of poetic imagery. Although it is set in the depths of a society\\'s systematic inhumanity, CAPERNAUM is ultimately a hopeful film that stirs the heart as deeply as it cries out for action.',\n",

By coaching an unrivaled stable of politicians over the course of fifty years, Ailes heavily influenced Republican politics, steering the conservative movement from Nixon, to the Tea Party, to Trump. Under his tutelage, anger and fear became the coin of the realm, both on the ballot and on national television. Diagnosed with hemophilia at an early age, it took someone intimate with fear to skillfully manipulate the fear of others. With Rupert Murdoch behind him, Roger Ailes started Fox News and turned it into a money-making juggernaut, with profits exceeding those of all its rivals combined. He discarded notions of traditional journalism and turned prime time television into flame-throwing TV. Short skirts and low necklines mesmerized his audience and, as long as Fox made money, there was little oversight of his fiefdom. But the carnival house mirror Ailes put up to America reflected his own distorted personal life. This is a story of serial cruelty, both on the public stage and in private life. Lik',\n",
